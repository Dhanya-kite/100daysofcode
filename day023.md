## STATEMENT:
### It is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, it requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.  

Given a placement of 8 queens on the chessboard. If there is a pair of queens that violates this rule, print YES, otherwise print NO. The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line, with each pair giving the position of a queen on a standard chessboard with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 8.

#### Sample I/O:
```
Example input
1 5
2 3
3 1
4 7
5 2
6 8
7 6
8 4


Example output
NO
```
### Program:
```
x = []
y = []
for i in range(0 , 8):
  a = [int(s) for s in input().split()]
  x.append(a[0])
  y.append(a[1])
result = 'NO'
for i in range(0 , 8):
  for j in range(i + 1, 8):
    if ((x[i] == x[j]) or (y[i] == y[j]) or (abs(x[i] - x[j]) == abs(y[i] - y[j]))):
      result = 'YES'
print(result)
```
